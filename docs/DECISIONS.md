# Decisions

## 2026-08-02 — Active-path empirical price qualification
- An empirical price conclusion applies only to the exact provider, retained version, and canonical data path tested.
- An inconclusive result remains unverified and cannot become a canonical assumption.
- Historical-only analysis may operate without a current price basis; market-dependent consumers remain fail closed.
- Paid-provider integration is deferred until an explicit source-authority and licensing decision.

## 2026-08-02 — Codex milestone governance
- Codex milestones are substantial and bounded: inspect, patch, focused tests, one real/frozen validation when needed, commit, and push.
- Passed gates are not reopened without new regression evidence.

## 2026-08-02 — Forward-only OHLCV and price-test lineage
- New OHLCV observations retain provider package version, adapter/schema version, endpoint, canonical field, retrieval time, session date, source-record hash, and source-specific scale in `ohlcv_lineage`.
- Historical rows without that retained record are `legacy_version_unknown`; no package version is inferred retroactively.
- A corporate action may qualify for price continuity without qualifying a share transition; it requires official citation/hash, explicit ex-date, and ratio lineage, while provider event identity is optional metadata.

## 2026-08-02 — Official price-test event authority
- Price-continuity event identity is derived deterministically from official authority, document hash, ticker, exchange, action type, explicit ex-date, and ratio basis.
- VCI corporate-action event IDs are optional metadata; an official event and a VCI price window join on ticker, exchange, qualified ex-date, and tested price path.
- Record date never substitutes for an explicit official ex-date.

## 2026-08-02 - Bounded official-document acquisition
- Official PDF acquisition uses deterministic headers, explicit connect/read limits, at most two attempts, bounded backoff, response validation, hash-addressed retention, and an atomically written manifest.
- A verified local hash-addressed document is a cache hit and prevents another network request; failed, empty, invalid, or partial transfers never become evidence.
